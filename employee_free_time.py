# Employee Free Time
# We are given a list schedule of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.

# Each employee has a list of non-overlapping Intervals, and these intervals are in sorted order.

# Return the list of finite intervals representing common, positive-length free time for all employees, also in sorted order.

# (Even though we are representing Intervals in the form [x, y], the objects inside are 
# Intervals, not lists or arrays. For example, schedule[0][0].start = 1, schedule[0][0].
# end = 2, and schedule[0][0][0] is not defined).  Also, we wouldn't include intervals #
# like [5, 5] in our answer, as they have zero length.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]
# Output: [[3,4]]
# Explanation: There are a total of three employees, and all common
# free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf].
# We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.
# Example 2:

# Input: schedule = [[[1,3],[6,7]],[[2,4]],[[2,5],[9,12]]]
# Output: [[5,6],[7,9]]
 
# Constraints:
#   - 1 <= schedule.length , schedule[i].length <= 50
#   - 0 <= schedule[i].start < schedule[i].end <= 10^8
