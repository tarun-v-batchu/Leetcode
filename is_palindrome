# Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, otherwise return false.
# A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. It is also case-insensitive and ignores all non-alphanumeric characters.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "Was it a car or a cat I saw?"
# Output: true
# Explanation: After considering only alphanumerical characters we have "wasitacaroracatisaw", which is a palindrome.
# 
# Example 2:
# Input: s = "tab a cat"
# Output: false
# Explanation: "tabacat" is not a palindrome.
#
# Constraints:
#   - 1 <= s.length <= 1000
#   - s is made up of only printable ASCII characters.

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        i = 0
        j = len(s) - 1
        while i < j :
            i+=1 while i < j and s[i].isalnum()
