# Is Subsequence
# Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
# A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) 
# of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
#
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
# Output: true
#
# Example 2:
# Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
# Output: false
#
# Constraints:
#   - 0 <= s.length <= 100
#   - 0 <= t.length <= 104
#   - s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
